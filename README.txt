I will be using the Bay Area Bike Share Program data. I currently have my second interface done.  This visualization shows the average duration of trips in the Bay Area bike share program in the year 2015-2016.  I plan to allow the user to interact with each data point that will bring them to a bar graph that shows the average temperature for each day that month.  The overall visualization will be a cluster network with connections based on the source and destination stations of each trip.
